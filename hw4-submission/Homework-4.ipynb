    "(in general): As you can see in my first code cell, I gathered and aggregated a lot more data than I ended up actually needing. After looking into the data, different types of averages worked best. I did not end up using any NLP results, along with category or brand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 1 - For task one, I implemented an aggregation of global, specific user and specific item averages. I chose this to model the user and item bias on the global mean, where I gave equal weight to the global mean rating, the user average ratings and the item average ratings. It turned out to work quite well on the unknown testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2 - For task two, I only used one piece of data: whether the number of times this item was purchased was greater than the mean of purchased items. I tried many other things and nothing could beat it. In my other attempts, I used the user's propensity to buy anything at all, buy things at certain prices, or buy things with certain average ratings. Nothing outperformed the simple check I ended up using. \n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3 - For task three, I used a similiar method as with task one, giving equal weight to two averages, the global percentage of reviews that are helpful, and how helpful each users' reviews are. Again, I tried several other methods and this performed the best."
